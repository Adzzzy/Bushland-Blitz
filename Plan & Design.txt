Object Oriented Programming – Project Planning
Description:
Bushland Blitz a short turn-based combat game based in the Australian Outback.
Classes contain – an enemy, a player, and moves
User interface using ncurses – for main menu and navigating moves.
As moved get learnt then get concatenated to a dynamic array.

Plan:
Week 1
-	Work on classes and interaction between classes – create base skeleton and functions for each class
o	Jonasz – Enemies – also rough interface
o	Adam – Moves Class
o	Billy – Player Class
-	Interactions between objects refined – ie how enemys interact with the player, and moves interact the player, etc.
-	Other work
o	Jonasz – interface and menu for fighting using ncurses

Week 2 –
-	Adam - Work on game difficulties
-	Jonasz - Work on randomly generated enemies
-	Billy / Adam – Work on Item Class
-	Add additional states and behaviours to classes – generally make the game more interesting

Work out bugs and error as they appear

Game Outline:
-	Main menu – start game – settings – exit game
-	Start game -> Enter your name -> lore / story displays on screen
-	At start and between each enemy some text saying ‘enemy approaches’
-	Start with two basic moves, boomerang throw, club strike
-	Learn a new move every 5 enemies, you learn a new one. IF we have enough time, choose from 3 moves.
-	FOR CURRENT MODE: 5 different enemies, unlock 2 moves.
-	Interface displays health and spirit, and separate little menu for moves.
-	Fighting is turn based, choose a move with arrow pointer using arrow keys and press enter to use it

-	Difficulties, decides how many enemies to fight in total to win the game
-	The enemy which spawns is determined from a pool of enemies which can spawn, the pool changes to have harder enemies to choose from at later fights. E.g. fight 0-5 has a pool of relatively easy enemies then fight 6-10 chooses from a pool of much harder enemies. Higher difficulties have more fights, so harder pools as well.
-	Turn-based and the player will usually move first
-	Unique enemy traits, a type of enemy which may be able to occasionally attack twice in a row. Slow enemy which does not attack each turn but unleashes a very strong attack when it does.
-	Status ailments for player such as speed boost which allows them to attack twice, or a poison de-buff which damages them each turn.
-	Certain enemies may drop certain items as rewards (cure to poison, speed booster, damage booster, max hp booster, spirit booster). Items take a turn to use and must be used mid-battle.
-	Enemy class has virtual method named ‘attack’, a generic attack for all enemies, parameter is a string – name of move and int – damage of move. Each enemy has specific, name and damage function in enemy.cpp etc. specific unique attacks go in method of each subclass.
-	Boomerang club and spear require no spirit, later you learn moves that do
-	Work out how to do dymaic array of players move list
