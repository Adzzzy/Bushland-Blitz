# Bushland-Blitz
Object-Oriented Programming Project - A Short JRPG-Style Game

The game takes place in the Australian Outback as the player faces a gauntlet of enemies with enemies becoming stronger each time one is defeated.
The enemies and player each have various attacks with different damages, effects, and accuracies.
The player also has attacks called spells that require spirit to cast.
Health comes back with each battle won, but spirit stays the same.
Additionally, the player picks up an item each time they defeat an enemy, with each of these items having various effects.
The effects of these items include: restoring health, restoring spirit, raising max health, raising max spirit, and curing status ailments.
If the player makes it far enough, they'll see new, fierce enemies, and beyond that, something even greater ...

Note: The Ncurses programming library needs be installed in order to compile the game as it takes advantage of the tools it provides to create text-based user interfaces.
